#+TITLE: Design Notes for Sleepsaver 2
#+AUTHOR: Arthur Amalvy

- Equivalence between ~sleepsaver::move~ and ~string~ so that one can
  be converted to the other easily
- Keep the concept of estimated time
- Possibility to hide actions
- Actual hitbox of the robot
- keep define-move?
- each action could be a list of move (easier manipulation?)
- maps as SVGs
  - drawing is done directly on this SVG
- Configs
  - Embed their move, basis
  - An easy to use config system, where registering a move allows
    unregistering it easily!
